# Customer_Comparison
The Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to solve several tasks with the help of Machine Learning and this project seeks to advise them on that possibility.

Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing.

Task 2: Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Prove that the predicted model performs better than a dummy model

Task 3: Predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model.

Task 4: Use data obfuscation to protect clients' personal data in such a way that the quality of machine learning models doesn't suffer.
